Real-Time Ray Tracer with Object Integration and Local Shading

Description
This project is a custom-built real-time ray tracing engine written in C++, focused on rendering 3D scenes with integrated geometric objects and realistic lighting. The system supports OBJ file parsing, dynamic scene updates, geometric transformations, and local shading models for improved realism.

 Key Features
    • OBJ File Import: Loads complex 3D objects (e.g., Rubik’s cube) from external `.obj` files into the ray tracing scene.
    • Geometric Transformations: Supports scaling, rotation, and translation of objects with accurate mathematical handling.
    • Local Shading Model: Applies custom shaders for realistic light reflection, color blending, and surface behavior.
    • Scene Optimization: Designed to handle multiple objects efficiently while maintaining rendering performance.
    • Custom Shader Logic: Demonstrates detailed understanding of color interpolation, light falloff, and ray-object interaction.
    
  Technologies Used
    • C++ (Core Engine)
    • OpenGL or custom framebuffer (if applicable)
    • OBJ Parser (custom or third-party)
    • Linear Algebra & Vector Math
