This project,is the part of my Advanced Computer Graphics,is a custom-built real-time ray tracing engine written in C++, focused on rendering 3D scenes with integrated geometric objects and realistic lighting. The system supports OBJ file parsing, dynamic scene updates, geometric transformations, and local shading models for improved realism.
